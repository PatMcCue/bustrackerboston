# Real-Time Bus Tracker
This is a real-time bus tracker application that displays the movement of a set of buses in Boston on a map. The application retrieves bus location data from the MBTA API and updates the markers on the map accordingly.

## Description
This project utilizes the Google Maps API and the MBTA API to track and display the real-time locations of buses in Boston. The bus locations are fetched from the MBTA API at regular intervals and displayed as markers on the map. The markers are updated as the buses move, providing a real-time visualization of their positions.

## How to Run
To run this project on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have a web browser installed (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox).
2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/PatMcCue/bustrackerboston`
3. Open the bustracker.html file in a web browser.
4. Obtain a Google Maps API key by following the Google Maps API documentation.
5. Replace YOUR_API_KEY in the script tag with your actual Google Maps API key.
6. Open the bustracker.html file with your web browser.
7. You should now see a map displaying the real-time bus locations in Boston.
Note: Internet connectivity is required for the application to fetch bus data from the MBTA API.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements
In the future, the following improvements can be considered for this repository:

- Enhancing the user interface to provide more detailed information about the buses, such as bus routes and estimated arrival times.
- Adding additional features, such as user interaction to select specific bus routes or toggle the display of specific buses.
- Optimizing the performance by implementing efficient data fetching techniques and marker updates.
- Exploring the possibility of integrating other transit APIs to track buses in different cities or regions.
